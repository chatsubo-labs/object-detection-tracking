## Computer Vision: Object Recognition

Object recognition and motion tracking is the estimation of the trajectory of an object over time by locating the object’s position in every frame. When the object is detected, motion tracking is applied to record the object’s movement across time that the object is in view. The ability to detect an object and track its motion is a challenging and actively researched field in today’s world. This project demonstrates how a frisbee can be identified and monitored while in motion.
